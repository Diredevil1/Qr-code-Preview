### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

Ps.I thought to use bootsrap which would have made it very easy, but decided against that to learn more ^^

### What I learned

Not really much new learnt, basically went through basic html/css, I guess I will learn many good tips through feedback!

### Continued development

I really want to make content alive and modern, what I really lack is knowledge in css to make everything look good, an example would be tkaing advantage of shadows, overlaping and such.
